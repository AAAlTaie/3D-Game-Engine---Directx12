# 3D-Game-Engine---Directx12

Welcome to the 3DGameEngine-Directx12 repository! This project is a ground-up implementation of a 3D game engine using DirectX 12. The aim is to create a powerful, efficient, and flexible engine that can be used for developing modern 3D games with cutting-edge graphics and performance.

 # Features

1. DirectX 12 Integration: Leverage the full power of DirectX 12 for advanced graphics rendering.
2. Real-time Rendering: High-performance real-time rendering pipeline.
3. Physics Engine: Integrated physics engine for realistic simulations.
4. Lighting and Shadows: Advanced lighting and shadow techniques, including real-time global illumination.
5. Asset Management: Efficient asset management system for textures, models, and other resources.
6. Scripting Support: Extend the engine's capabilities with a built-in scripting language.
6. Cross-Platform: Designed with cross-platform compatibility in mind (initially focusing on Windows, with potential for future expansion).
